# 🗳️ On-Chain Voting Polls

## 📜 Project Description

This project is a decentralized **voting system** built on the **Stacks blockchain** using **Clarity smart contracts**. It allows users to participate in polls without relying on centralized servers, ensuring transparency and immutability.  

The smart contract enables **admin-controlled poll creation**, **single-vote enforcement per wallet**, and **on-chain vote storage**, making the system fully trustless and verifiable.
